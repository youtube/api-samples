Minimum Go version: go 1.1+

To run these code samples, you will need to install the dependent libraries via
the "go get" command. These code samples require the goauth2 and google-api-go-client
libraries which can be installed with the following commands:

   go get code.google.com/p/goauth2/oauth
   go get code.google.com/p/google-api-go-client/youtube/v3

The keyword search and topic search samples can be run via the standard "go run" command
once the developerKey constant is populated with an API key created at
https://code.google.com/apis/console.

Example usage:

   go run search_by_keyword.go

The Freebase API and YouTube Data APIs must be enabled for the project associated with this
key.

To run any sample that requires authorization on behalf of a user, such as checking
for uploads, this requires the shared oauth.go file to be passed as a parameter to "go run".
These samples require a "Web Application" client ID and client secret pair which can
also be created at the Google API console at https://code.google.com/apis/console. Once
a client ID and secret pair have been created, these values must be populated into
client_secrets.json in the corresponding fields. A template client_secrets.json has been
provided in client_secrets.json.sample. Rename this file and populate the fields.

Example usage:

   go run my_uploads.go oauth.go

oauth.go contains code that is shared between the code samples that require OAuth 2.0 
authorization, so it must be passed as a parameter to "go run".
